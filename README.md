# Bank-Churn-Prediction-
Bank Churn Prediction — Neural Network vs XGBoost

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal was to analyze customer behavior, identify important features, and build models that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

I experimented with two approaches:

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

XGBoost Classifier

The neural network was trained with multiple layers and standard preprocessing steps; however, due to the size and nature of the dataset, it did not perform as well as expected. After training both models, the XGBoost classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 86%, which is why it was selected as the final model for this project.

The workflow of the project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical features

Feature scaling

Training ANN and XGBoost models

Performance comparison using accuracy and classification metrics

Selecting the best model for deployment

This repository contains the full code, model training steps, visualizations, and explanations of how the final model was chosen.

The aim of the project is to demonstrate a practical and structured approach to solving a real-world classification problem, and to highlight how model comparison helps in selecting the most reliable solution.
